		<h1>Soccer Framework</h1>

	<h6>Responsible: Andreas Bott Kristensen (s123056)</h6>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>In this task we had to build and develop a framework of a soccer field in the simulation program VREP. The main goal was to have a field of play where the individual groups could place their robots and play against each other. In order to do this a set of rules were made. Since this task was made together with one from each group a seperate website has been assigned just for this.</p>

	<h2>Design</h2>
	<p>As seen on the picture below we created a field with two goals, rounded corners and walls around except at the goal areas. When the ball is has gone into the void a goal is detected and them game is reset. The reason for the rounded corners was to insure that the ball or robot wouldn't get trapped there. The idea behind the colored goals, walls and ball was to make it easier for the groups to use vision sensors etc.</p>

	<h2>Tournament</h2>
	<p>In the tournament every group had to make an identical pair of blue and green robots. The duration of a game was 3 minutes but simulating an actual game took way more time than this and so the games was instead simulated and recorded and then shown on the big screen.</p>

	<p>Unicorn Riders also won this competition.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Given only three weeks to develop a framework of a working football pitch with robots playing I think that we succeeded. Although more time in developing more dynamic and better soccer robots was missing since the games was not at all exciting.</p>
