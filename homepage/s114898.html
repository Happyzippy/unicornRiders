<h2>Abstract</h2>
A wheeled autonomous robot was built for the first task, with inspiration from kiddie tricycles. 
Embodied artificial intelligence was successfully implemented to allow for autonomous movement through the obstacle track.


<h2>Hardware Design</h2>
The robot uses 2 servo motors in wheel mode for the backwheels, and an extra servo motor in position mode for frontwheel steering.
A long axle rod was used to attach the front
